                            <p class="card-text">Building meaningful relationships with students and alumni is important for the strategic growth and advancement of higher education programs. Though alumni typically move away from campus to pursue a career, they can stay in touch and build a global professional network. Current students at institutions benefit from the mentorship opportunities and improved job placement rates that engaged alumni bring. And institutions are able to partner with alumni to meet financial goals for scholarships and other campus developments. For example, in 2019–2020, 47.8 percent of Princeton University's alumni community raised nearly $66.3 million—the fourth-highest amount in the university's history.
